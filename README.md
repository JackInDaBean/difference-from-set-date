# difference-from-set-date

This was a university assignment that was mainly used to test our knowledge of if statements.

This program will ask for a difference in days (both negative and positive)

It will then ask for a date, then do the calculation - it uses the if statements to factor in year changes, month changes and leap years affecting February - March. 

I see now that I could have placed most of the calculations into functions or used loops but for this assignment it was not necessary.
